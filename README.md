## **Introduction**
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. This tool allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using this method.

---

## **How It Works**
- **Encryption**: Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a specified number of positions.
- **Decryption**: The encrypted text is shifted back by the same number of positions to retrieve the original plaintext.

---

## **Features**
- Encrypt plaintext using a user-defined shift value.
- Decrypt ciphertext using the same shift value.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Non-alphabet characters (e.g., numbers, symbols) remain unchanged.
- Implemented in **C++**, **Java**, and **Python**.

---

## **Installation**
### **C++**
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++` or `clang++`).
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++11 caesar_cipher.cpp -o caesar_cipher
---

## **Usage**
1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python encrypt.py
