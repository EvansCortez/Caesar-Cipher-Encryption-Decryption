## **Introduction**
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. This tool allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using this method.

---

## **How It Works**
- **Encryption**: Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a specified number of positions.
- **Decryption**: The encrypted text is shifted back by the same number of positions to retrieve the original plaintext.

---

## **Features**
- Encrypt plaintext using a user-defined shift value.
- Decrypt ciphertext using the same shift value.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Non-alphabet characters (e.g., numbers, symbols) remain unchanged.

## **Installation**
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Clone this repository or download the `encrypt.py` file.

---

## **Usage**
1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python encrypt.py
